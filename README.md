# js-pixelizer
A hacky approach to pixelize and color reduce an image on the fly using Javascript.

Run this on a server and not from the file system, because running it from the file system causes security errors in some browsers.

This runs fine in Chrome and Firefox, it kind of runs in Edge (but very slowly) and it doesn't run in IE.
